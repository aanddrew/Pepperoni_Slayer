Welcome to Pepperoni Slayer!

This was a project developed by Andrew Weller (andrewweller.cs@gmail.com).

[Here is a video explaining the project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9Sg7Plq3YA)

I made my own 3d engine that can draw quads facing cardinal directions and small enemy circles in the sky by applying simple principles of perspective. I was thinking about making a youtube video explaining the 	process.

Right now I need to comment this code and make it more readable.

Here's a little introduction to the game:

The object of the game is simple.

Stay alive for as many rounds as possible.
Attack the Pepperonis to keep them from hitting you (ouch).

You lose when you either fall off the edge of the map or your health is reduced to zero.

The controls are explained in a more graphically friendly manner in the ReadMe.png file,
or you can just read this.

	WASD - move: forward, left, backward, right

	E - purchase weapons from the shops (blue circles around the map)

	R - reload

	Space or Mouse Wheel - jump

	Escape - Pause

	Mouse - Move to look around
		Left click to shoot

Have fun!
