Welcome to Pepperoni Slayer!

The object of the game is simple.

Stay alive for as many rounds as possible.
Attack the Pepperonis to keep them from hitting you (ouch).

You lose when you either fall off the edge of the map or your health is reduced to zero.

The controls are explained in a more graphically friendly manner in the ReadMe.png file,
or you can just read this.

	WASD - move: forward, left, backward, right

	E - purchase weapons from the shops (blue circles around the map)

	R - reload

	Space or Mouse Wheel - jump

	Escape - Pause

	Mouse - Move to look around
		Left click to shoot

Have fun!
